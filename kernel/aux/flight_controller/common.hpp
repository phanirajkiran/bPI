 * - if a sensor is not connected, it does not lead to a fatal error and the
 *   fight controller will still run.
 * - it guarantees that the motor output is never activated or changed
 *   automatically. however it is still possible to do it manually via console.
 *   (if FLIGHT_CONTROLLER_DEBUG_MODE is set below, motors are initialized to
 *   minimum thrust)
 * 
 * this allows you to use the serial console and for example display sensor
 * values & input control values and set motor output speed manually.
