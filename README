Banana Pi is a minimal kernel, mainly for educational purposes. It runs on the
Raspberry Pi. But its modular design allows it to be easily ported to other
boards and platforms.


Features
--------

- GPIO
- Timer
- serial: UART via GPIO pins
- ATAG's: read & parse ATAG list, given by the bootloader
- play audio via PWM (3.5 mm phone connector of the PI), play WAVE files or a
  single frequency
- generic printk method (like printf)



Miscellaneous
-------------

If you have any improvements or suggestions you are welcome to implement them
and/or contact me.
