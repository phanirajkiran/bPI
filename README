Banana Pi is a minimal kernel, mainly for educational purposes. It runs on the
Raspberry Pi. But its modular design allows it to be easily ported to other
boards and platforms.


Features
--------

- GPIO
- Timer
- serial: UART via GPIO pins
- ATAG's: read & parse ATAG list, given by the bootloader
- play audio via PWM (3.5 mm phone connector of the PI), play WAVE files (see
  branch play_wave) or a single frequency
- generic printk method (like printf)
- interrupts: arm irq handler & timer interrupts


Build
-----
- install an appropriate cross-compiler (eg arm-none-eabi-gcc)
- choose a cross-compiler: edit TOOLCHAIN in file Makefile
  (or use: make TOOLCHAIN=xy)

$ make
- this will build the kernel as kernel.img
- make sure the load address is correct. if not edit the linker script


Miscellaneous
-------------

If you have any improvements or suggestions you are welcome to implement them
and/or contact me.
